Azure Synapse Analytics is changing the way we work with data services in Azure. The ASA workspace combines the core technologies required for **data warehousing**, **Big Data Analytics** and **Data Science**.

In this project, we will use **Synapse Analytics** to solve the paradox of analytics with a unified analytical platform where **data analysts**, **data engineers** and **data scientists** can all perform essential tasks in the same workspace.
